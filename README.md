**Please clearly describe the challenge you are looking to solve with technology and how this solution addresses the challenge at hand**

          Currently, a student who wants to study Anatomy of different parts (organs) of the Human Body has to look and 
    understand everything from a picture or diagram.
          AR in Anatomy is an app that lets students explore the human body to understand how it works. By using this 
    app Users can see Anatomy of different Human body parts in action, rotate them, zoom in and out. The app also 
    gives labeling of small parts too. AR helps the student better remember the information they have just learned.
