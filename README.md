**Please share a 2 minute or less video showing off the user journey of your solution**


**Please clearly describe the challenge you are looking to solve with technology and how this solution addresses the challenge at hand**

          Currently, a student who wants to study Anatomy of different parts (organs) of the Human Body has to look and 
    understand everything from a picture or diagram.
          AR in Anatomy is an app that lets students explore the human body to understand how it works. By using this 
    app Users can see Anatomy of different Human body parts in action, rotate them, zoom in and out. The app also 
    gives labeling of small parts too. AR helps the student better remember the information they have just learned. 

**Walk us through the steps you took to test your solution**


**Please share the outcome of your testing strategy. What specific feedback did you receive from users? What specifically 
did you maintain or iterate based on that feedback?**




**How will or has your solution improved the lives of people in your community?**


**Please walk us through the steps you took to build your solution. Include which products or platforms you used and why. Please include guidance on how to run your code.**

    1) The first task was to look for 3D files of Anatomy of Different parts of Human Body which are useful for 
       students for these we used Sketchfab's Unity Plugin. After these 3D files were resized/scaled according 
       to expecting size in reality.

</p>

    2) Prepare Unity's AR scene and make multiple copies of that scene after that replace the 3D object present in each 
       scene with imported 3D files. 

**What do you see as the future / next steps for your project? What will take your project to the next level?**

                   Till now the app that we have developed is completely offline there is no need to worry about 
    internet connection in order to see Anatomy of different parts because by default 13 (Body parts) 3D objects 
    are already there. To take the app to the next level I would like to connect it to the cloud so that user 
    can select any part from many available options he wants to see using our app. Also to give VR capability 
    to our app.                
          
**What specific support do you need to achieve that?**


**Describe your favorite component (s) /feature (s) of your technical infrastructure and why you chose it/them for your solution.**
                    
                    My favorite technical infrastructure of my App is whatever 3D models (Anatomy of Parts) are
    available user can explore/see them in real-world (Augmented Reality)  Normally 3D models are available on 
    internet on different sites but the user is able to explore them using Laptop/Desktop, normally they don't 
    support mobile phones.
